In order to filter the data, user may enter any of these fields to pull the data on the table. Your results will get more specific as fields are added.
For example, the following search will show results for UFO sightings in Oregon for date 1/12/2010.

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that you canâ€™t filter the results in alphabetical order for further analyzation. To better understand a pattern in UFO sightings, coordinates and time of day should be added to the data. By adding filters to each column, you are able to find more patterns to find state where more sightings are recorded. You can also find the longest and shortest sighting. There would be more possibilities to find patterns in the data provided.
